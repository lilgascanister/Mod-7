> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- At first, the experience was quite rough. I had a problem navigating through the given tutorials and guidelines. After ten minutes or so, I got the hang of it and started to understand what I was 
    asked to do. After that, the experience was quite nice.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- To create the test cases, I observed the GitLab site and thought of different ways to describe the test cases in the most simple way possible. 


## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
- I think the way this was done there is no need to use any tools or styles.  
    

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code to edit the files. With Visual Studio Code I have all kinds of extensions that smooth the process of editing the files.
    

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I didn't find any troubles.
    

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I'm quite familiar with Github, so I didn't run into any major obstacles.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I would propably use Robot Framework, because I've used that in one of the RPA courses at Laurea, so I have some knowledge on how it works and how you could use it. 



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- At "SAP Testing chief" for Accenture Nordics, there was emphasized that strong understanding on SAP automation is required. Another was ALTEN Finland and they searched for Test Automatino Engineer. In that
job listing they required Robot Framework, Jenkins and Linux knowledge. Also there was some DevOps and cloud-based experience like AWS and Microsoft Azure. Overall, it seems that a strong understanding of some
technology is beneficial and combined with other skills, you would easily find multiple different job listings and maybe through them you could land yourself a job.



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I would focus more on the Robot Framework and to the automating process of software testing. 




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I believe that the materials and quizzes done before this helped me to put my theoretical knowledge into use. At first I had some difficulties navigationg through the project, but after a while I started to fully
understand what I was needed to do. After that realization, creating test cases and other tasks were quite fun and rewarding. I wouldn't say that there is any need to modify those current study modules, they are more than
enough for students to learn about the fundamentals of software testing.
